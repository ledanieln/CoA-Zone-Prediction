This project is labeled urban features in Austin to predict zoning districts. This project was completed for a Data Mining class at Texas State University.

# Background
This is one of my first attempts at developing a 'data science' project. We received labeled data from the City of Austin that digitized structures, paved roads, and other urban features. I combined the labeled data with zoning district data from the City of Austin GIS database with the hopes of being able to predict zoning districts from the labeled features.

# Motivation
For my project, I wanted to go through the entire data science process, from feature generation and feature selection, to building a model that would be able to predict zoning districts (Residential, Commercial, Industrial) from digitized and labeled polygon data. With my expertise in handling spatial data and spatial analysis, I hope to develop a pipeline for future prediction of zoning from labeled polygon data.
